# Team Profile Generator

This app allows the user to dynamically create a team profile in the command line through node.js and inquirer.

You begin by answering questions about your manager:

Note that we have used inquirer's built in validation abilities to ensure that we are getting correct inputs from the user.

After we've added our manager, we are asked if we would like to add additional employees.

We can continue to add additional engineers and interns until we have added the entire team.

Once we say that we are done adding employees, the team.html file is automatically generated.
